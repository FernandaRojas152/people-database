## People database :bar_chart:
## What is it?
people-database is made to help with CRUD functions with a big data generate, here you can create a maximum of one billion of people so we can simulate a real database worldwide, with those data generated, you can create more by input all data by yourself, you can search between data and display an auto-complete dialog, and it can delete and modify each person. <br>
- It was made with Java, JavaFX and CSS
- Uses generics and decoupling
- We make our own implementation of some data structures.
- You need to have installed jdk so you can download and use this project
